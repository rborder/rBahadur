\title{Functions to compute equilibrium parameters under assortative mating}
\usage{
h2_eq(r, h2_0)

rg_eq(r, h2_0)

vg_eq(r, vg_0, h2_0)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{cross-mate phenotypic correlation}

\item{h2_0}{generation zero (panmictic) heritability}

\item{vg_0}{generation zero (panmictic) additive genetic variance component}
}
\value{
A single numerical quantity representing the equilibrium heritability (\code{h2_eq}),
the equilibrium cross-mate genetic correlation (\code{rg_eq}), or the equilibrium genetic
variance (\code{vg_eq}).
}
\description{
Compute heritability ('h2_eq'), genetic variance ('vg_0'), and cross-mate genetic
correlation ('rg_eq') at equilibrium under univariate primary-phenotypic assortative mating.
These equations can be derived from Nagylaki's results (see below) under the assumption
that number of causal variants is large (i.e., taking the limit as the number of causal
variants approaches infinity).
